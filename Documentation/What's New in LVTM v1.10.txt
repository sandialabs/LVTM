* Rechecking for new app instances upon mouse over "App Instance" control
* Do not limit multisection to siblings only
* Do not allow selection of parent libraries
* For "Clone VIs FG" made the "Add Calling VI" case the default case
* Tree right-click menu now allows for Expand_All/Collapse_All library nodes
* Items not belonging to a parent library are now grouped in tree under "<no parent library>"
* Marked "Pause.vi" User Event terminals as Connection Optional, and added text to the VI description warning to NOT wire these terminals.
* Relocated the LVTM "Regression Tests" VIs such that they are no longer excluded from view in LVTM by default
* Many performance optimizations (including 'dependencies cache' per Neil Pate)
* Do not create new template instances, and suppress loading dialogs (per xceric)
* Persist the column sorting between refreshes
* Persist the collapsed/expanded state of each library node in the tree, between refreshes

* Several UI improvements
* View can now be grouped by Library or Folder, or display a Flat List
* Added an ability to filter out items from being displayed, per folder paths.  Helps the user to de-clutter the view, and improves performance.

* Added a progress bar for refresh
* Persist some configuration settings
* Other performance improvements
* Added a basic plugin architecture
