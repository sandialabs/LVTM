What's New in LVTM v1.10.0 since v1.7.0
* Rechecking for new app instances upon mouse over "App Instance" control
* Do not limit multisection to siblings only
* Do not allow selection of parent libraries
* For "Clone VIs FG" made the "Add Calling VI" case the default case
* Tree shortcut menu (right-click menu) several functions
* Items not belonging to a parent library are now grouped in tree under "<no parent library>"
* Relocated the LVTM "Regression Tests" VIs such that they are no longer excluded from view in LVTM by default
* Many performance optimizations (including 'dependencies cache' per Neil Pate)
* Do not create new template instances, and suppress loading dialogs (per xceric)
* Persist the column sorting between refreshes
* Persist the collapsed/expanded state of each library node in the tree, between refreshes
* Persist the selected item between refreshes, if it still exists
* New Help/About/Info dialog
* License is now modified MIT
* New icon
* Several UI improvements
* View can now be grouped by Class/Library or Folder, or display a Flat List
* Added an ability to filter out items from being displayed, per folder paths.  Helps the user to de-clutter the view, and improves performance.
* Added a progress bar for refresh
* Persist some configuration settings between sessions
* Several performance improvements
* Added an ability to remotely close any VI's Front Panel.  Useful when a modal dialog prevents interacting with LabVIEW, including the LVTM window.
